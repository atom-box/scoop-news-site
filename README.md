This program was completed for the Codecademy course "Build Your Own API's"
December 9, 2017 

The Scoop has nine files, written in javascript and node.js.   
The school, Codecademy wrote the longer files, including the HTML and the functionality for 
much of the website. 
My job was to figure out the existing data logic and extend their program to 
allow users to comment
on news stories.
